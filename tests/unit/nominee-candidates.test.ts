// Writing failing test first.
//
// Spec 395 U3 — who the nominee picker may offer.
//
// ⚠️ THE BUG THIS CLOSES, found while building U2: the picker listed ONLY workers with
// no bank account of their own ("เลือกช่างที่ยังไม่มีบัญชีธนาคารของตัวเอง"). Every worker
// spec 395 is about HAS an account — it just is not theirs — so **none of the 8 live
// cases was selectable through the normal flow at all**. U2 could only reach them by
// deep-linking `?worker=<uuid>`, which works but is not a route a human finds.
//
// The population is therefore a UNION of two reasons a nominee makes sense:
//   no-account       — the original spec 320 case: nothing of their own to pay into
//   not-own-account  — spec 395's case: an account that belongs to someone else
//
// ⚠️ Contractor-tied workers stay excluded from BOTH arms (spec 328 U3): a pay-exempt
// subcon member is permanently bankless BY DESIGN — the firm pays the subcontractor,
// so routing a nominee payout for one would move money PRC never owes. Measured
// 2026-08-05: all 8 live `unrecorded` workers are firm-paid, so this excludes none of
// them today; it is the rule that matters, not the current count.
