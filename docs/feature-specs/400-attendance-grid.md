# Spec 400 — ตารางเช็คชื่อ (the attendance grid)

**Status:** spec only. No unit built.
**Audience:** the procurement team running the attendance double-check (spec 397's
ask), plus every other member of `ATTENDANCE_AUDIT_ROLES`.
**Surface:** `/team/attendance` — the same route, a second view. No new nav entry.

Operator, 2026-08-06, on the surface spec 397 shipped one day earlier:

> uxui is unacceptable. you can recommend user to use bigger screens, but design
> better intuitive uxui. how about calendar view?

Two things are granted there and both change the design space: the audience may be
told to use a **bigger screen**, and the operator is asking for a **shape**, not a
tweak. This spec takes the shape seriously and narrows it — a per-worker month
calendar already exists and is not the missing piece.

---

## 1. Why — what the current report structurally cannot show

`/team/attendance` renders one row per worker: name, days present, OT hours, signal
chips, an expandable per-day drill, a CSV link. Every row is derived **from
attendance rows**. That is the defect, and it is not a matter of taste — two of the
three findings a checker most needs are unrenderable in that shape.

Measured live 2026-08-06:

**① A worker who was never scanned has no row at all.** 41 active workers;
**30** appear anywhere in July. The other **11** are not "shown as zero" — they are
absent from the page, because the query that builds the page starts at the
attendance table. "Nobody recorded ต้อม all month" is exactly a double-check
finding, and today it is invisible by construction.

**② A barely-mustered day disappears into per-worker totals.** Headcount by day:

| Jul | 24  | 25  | 26  | 27  | **28** | 29  | 30  | 31  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------ | --- | --- | --- |
|     | 13  | 17  | 18  | 17  | **1**  | 24  | 22  | 23  |

| Aug | **01** | 02  | 03  | **04** | 05  |
| --- | ------ | --- | --- | ------ | --- |
|     | **1**  | 15  | 21  | **4**  | 23  |

07-28 (1 person), 08-01 (1) and 08-04 (4) against a baseline of 17–24 are the days
a checker should open first. 08-04 is already known to be a real hole — spec 397 U3
was proved against it. On the current report each of those days contributes `+1` to
a few workers' "days present" and nothing anywhere says the day was thin.

**③ Nobody is using it.** `/team/attendance` has **zero** route views by any
procurement principal — before or since spec 397 U1/U2 shipped the access and the
door (39 views by `super_admin`, 3 by `accounting`, in 30 days). One day post-ship
is not yet damning, but the surface has to earn the second visit.

### What already exists, and must not be rebuilt

**Spec 374 shipped a calendar on 2026-07-29**: `/workers/[workerId]/attendance`, a
month grid for **one** worker — in–out per cell, OT, `(+1 วัน)`, `บันทึกมือ`,
off-home project code, holiday chips. It is good and it stays.

So the literal reading of "calendar view" is already done. The missing instrument
is the **cross-worker** one: you cannot see 41 people at once, which is where both
findings above live. This spec builds that and links to 374 rather than duplicating
it.

---

## 2. Decisions

### D1 — the shape is a worker × day MATRIX, not a month calendar

Rows = workers. Columns = the days of the selected range. One cell per
(worker, date). A calendar's month layout (weeks as rows) can only ever show one
subject; a matrix shows the whole crew against the same time axis, which is what
makes an outlier visible **without anyone writing a rule for it**: a nearly empty
column, an entirely empty row, one person present on a day the crew was not.

### D2 — spec 358 rejected this shape, and all three of its reasons have expired

Spec 358 §"Shape" rejected the worker × day matrix as primary. Re-read against this
audience, each reason fails:

| 358's reason                | Why it does not transfer                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "payroll audits per worker" | This audience is not payroll. Oversight is a **scanning** job — a different task needs a different instrument. |
| "mobile-hostile"            | Retired by the operator on 2026-08-06: procurement is office-tier and may be told to use a desktop.            |
| "export-unfriendly"         | The CSV is untouched. A screen and a file are different media (358 U4 already settled that for wording).       |

Recorded explicitly so a future audit does not re-raise the rejection as if it
still stood.

### D3 — the grid is SMALL, which is why this is buildable at all

41 roster rows × the days of a range, and only **13 dates have ever carried
attendance** (24 Jul – 05 Aug). A full month is ≤ 31 columns. This is one desktop
screen, not a virtualisation problem. If the range grows past a month the surface
stays honest by keeping the existing range form — no infinite grid.

### D4 — roster rows are role-split by live RLS, and there is NO admin widening

The `workers` "readable by staff" policy admits
`{site_admin, project_manager, procurement, procurement_manager, super_admin, project_director}`.
`accounting`, `hr` and `project_coordinator` are in `ATTENDANCE_AUDIT_ROLES` but
**not** in that policy — today they read attendance through the DEFINER RPC and
never touch the roster.

So finding ① ships **only to the roles that already own the roster**, read on the
**session client**. The other tier keeps exactly today's population (workers with
attendance). Two populations, one grid.

Rejected: reading the roster through the admin client for everyone. It would hand
`accounting`/`hr` a list of every worker including those who never worked — a real
PII widening — to serve a finding those roles have never asked for. If they want
it, that is a separate operator decision, not a side effect of a UI change.

⚠️ This also **corrects a written claim in spec 358**: that spec states
`workers.name` is "authenticated-readable". The live policy is role-gated. Anything
built on the old sentence should be re-checked.

### D5 — non-working days are SHADED, or the grid cries wolf

`public_holidays` is live with **23 rows** (`holiday_date`, `name_th`, spec 374 U2,
B.E. 2569). Sundays plus those dates render as a shaded column with no finding.

Without this, every Sunday is a 41-cell hole and the reader learns within a week
that holes mean nothing — the failure spec 358 U2 documented (a signal that fires
on every row is not a signal) and spec 341's always-amber board before it. The
shading is load-bearing, not decoration.

⚠️ `public_holidays` is **display-only by operator ruling** (374 §3b). Shading a
column must not change any count, any total, or any wage — it changes what is
DRAWN, nothing else.

### D6 — cell grain is the DATE; the column header carries the project-day facts

A date can carry a regular **and** an OT session (spec 351). The cell merges them —
earliest in, latest out, OT summed — which is exactly what
`buildAttendanceMonth` (`src/lib/attendance/attendance-month.ts`, spec 374) already
does. Reuse that semantic. Do **not** reach for `attendance-sessions.ts`: spec 388
keeps sessions apart on purpose for the ช่าง's own list, and its own header comment
says so.

Facts that belong to the **project-day**, never to a worker cell:

- **headcount** for the day (the finding in ②),
- **closure state** (`ปิดวันแล้ว` / `ยังไม่ปิดวัน` / `ยังอยู่ระหว่างวัน`).

This is spec 358 U2's correction carried forward: repeating a project-day fact on
every worker turns one missed `ปิดวัน` into N findings against N people. In a grid
that error would be 41× worse, so the column header is the only place it may live.

### D7 — same route, a `?view=` toggle, and the list survives

`/team/attendance?view=grid` (the default) and `?view=list` (today's report). No new
tab set, no `*_HUB_NAV` entry, no `roleHome` change — spec 358 deliberately spent
zero nav-SSOT budget on this report and that still holds.

The list is **not** deleted. It is the better shape for "read one person's month" and
it is what the CSV mirrors; a toggle costs one param and removes nothing.

### D8 — desktop-first, said out loud, and the scroll container is a house rule

The grid is a wide surface for an office audience. It scrolls horizontally inside
its own container — and every `overflow-x-auto` row in this app carries the
`[touch-action:pan-x_pinch-zoom]` PAIR (a build-failing guard enforces it). The
page body never scrolls sideways.

Narrow viewports get the LIST view, not a broken grid: the toggle's default is
resolved per viewport class only if that can be done without client JS; otherwise
the grid simply scrolls and the list stays one tap away.

### D9 — the drill is spec 374's calendar, and the link is role-conditional

A worker's name links to `/workers/[workerId]/attendance`. That page gates on
`WORKER_ROSTER_ROLES` = PM set + `procurement` + `procurement_manager` — so
**procurement can open it**, and `accounting` / `hr` / `project_coordinator`
cannot. An unconditional link would hand three roles a redirect.

Render the link exactly for `WORKER_ROSTER_ROLES`; the others keep the existing
in-page drill. `/payroll` already does this same role-conditional link to the same
page — follow it, do not invent a second pattern.

---

## 3. 🔔 The operator decision this spec is blocked on (units U3+)

**Finding a hole is not fixing it, and the people doing the finding cannot fix.**

Live gates, verified 2026-08-06 against `pg_get_functiondef`:

| Action                         | RPC                                    | plain `procurement` |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| read the audit report          | `audit_attendance_summary` / `_detail` | ✅                  |
| reopen a closed day            | `reopen_muster_day`                    | ✅                  |
| undo a wrong scan              | `muster_undo_scan`                     | ✅                  |
| **add a missing person**       | `muster_scan_in` / `open_muster_team`  | ❌                  |
| **record a missing check-out** | _no RPC exists for any role_           | ❌                  |
| **move a person's day**        | `move_muster_worker`                   | ❌                  |
| **close the day again**        | `close_muster_day`                     | ❌                  |

The four refusing RPCs all read
`{site_admin, super_admin, procurement_manager}`.

**And the split matters: 4 of the 5 procurement people are plain `procurement`**
(only zeeparn is `procurement_manager`). So for 80% of the team the power granted
by spec 397 is **destructive-only** — remove a wrong scan, never supply a right one
— while the commonest correction after finding a hole is _"he was here, add him"_.

A grid that surfaces 11 empty rows and a 1-person day to four people who cannot fix
any of them is a complaint generator, not a feature.

### The options

- **A — procurement may correct, bounded to a day they reopened.** Reuses the loop
  spec 397 U3 already built (reopen → fix → close). Needs: a write path for
  add-person and record-check-out, and a ruling on whether they may re-close.
- **B — procurement stays finder-only; the grid's action is "ส่งกลับให้ SA แก้".**
  No new privilege. Needs a new flag/queue and a notification path — and office-tier
  delivery is the app's weakest channel (LINE reaches no office-tier user at all;
  Telegram binding is at **4 of 41 users**, measured 2026-08-06).
- **C — do nothing; procurement tells the SA outside the app.** Which is what spec
  397 was asked to end.

**Recommendation: A, bounded to a reopened day, via ONE new DEFINER RPC** rather
than widening the four cockpit RPCs. Widening `open_muster_team` / `muster_scan_in`
hands procurement the cockpit's whole write surface with no door to it (dead
privilege), and `set_muster_team_wps` has no `kind` check — spec 397 §9 Q9 already
records that binding a WP to the office team is a wage path held shut only by
rate-0. A single narrow RPC keeps the blast radius nameable.

### ✅ OPERATOR RULING, 2026-08-06 — option A, and both sub-questions answered

> "A, build U1" … "yes re-close too, bind to any open day"

1. **Procurement may correct.** Option A.
2. **They may also RE-CLOSE.** Without it the loop strands: `close_muster_day` is
   what triggers `derive_muster_labor`, so a reopened-and-corrected day whose
   closer never comes leaves wages underived — leaving them worse off than before,
   having un-closed a day they cannot restore.
3. **Bound to ANY OPEN DAY, not only a reopened one.** This is the ruling that
   changed the design, and the measurement behind it: `reopen_muster_day` has
   **0 audit rows all-time** — the power shipped 2026-08-05 and has never been
   used. Gating corrections behind a reopen would have put a new capability behind
   a ritual nobody performs, which is spec §1③'s failure in a new costume. An open
   day is a state that already exists (6 project-days live).

⇒ **The rule is: `procurement` may write to a project-day that has no
`muster_day_closures` row.** A closed day still needs `reopen_muster_day` first —
which they already hold — so the reopen path is not retired, it is just no longer
the only door.

### What U3 must change (gate-checked live 2026-08-06)

- **`close_muster_day(p_project, p_date)`** — role list gains `procurement`, AND it
  needs the cross-project arm, because its second gate is
  `if not can_see_project(p_project)` which is **live-FALSE for procurement**.
  Same shape `reopen_muster_day` and `muster_undo_scan` already use:
  `v_role = 'procurement' or can_see_project(...)`. Widening only the role list
  would produce a `42501` at the second gate — the spec-397 two-allowlist trap.
- **`muster_scan_in(p_team, p_worker, p_method, p_session)`** — role list gains
  `procurement` + the same cross-project arm, PLUS a **closure guard, which it does
  not have today** (verified: the function never mentions `muster_day_closures`).
  It takes a TEAM, not a project-day, so the guard must resolve the team's
  `project_id`/`work_date` first.
  ⚠️ That the SA can currently scan into a CLOSED day is a **pre-existing hole**;
  U3 closes it for the new arm only and records it rather than silently changing
  the SA path.
- **A day with no team at all cannot be corrected**, because `muster_scan_in`
  requires one and `open_muster_team` needs a lead worker (`lead_worker_id` is
  NOT NULL for `kind='crew'`, spec 397 U4). U3 raises a NAMED error the UI turns
  into honest copy — "ยังไม่มีทีมของวันนั้น" — rather than inventing a lead.
- **The pgTAP role-set pin U2 owes lands here** (U3 touches `supabase/` anyway):
  assert the live `workers` "readable by staff" policy admits every member of
  `WORKER_ROSTER_ROLES`, over the exhaustive role domain. U2's TS pin catches a
  widened role set; only this catches a narrowed POLICY.
- Recording a **back-dated check-out** stays U4 — no RPC does it for any role.

### ⚠️ What the gate-check above MISSED — found at build time, 2026-08-06

The list above names two gates per function and is **incomplete**. It was derived by
reading `close_muster_day`'s own body, and a body-read cannot see a gate reached
through a callee.

**`close_muster_day` PERFORMs `derive_muster_labor`, which carries a THIRD gate** —
role list `{site_admin, project_manager, super_admin, project_director,
procurement_manager}` plus its own `can_see_project` with no cross-project arm, and
its comment reads _"Same authority as the labour engine (log_labor_day).
Money-writing."_ So widening `close_muster_day` alone left procurement passing two
gates and dying at the third: affordance-then-refuse, the three-layer class.

It surfaced because U3a's pgTAP drives the RPC **behaviourally** (`lives_ok`), which
reported `42501: derive_muster_labor: role not permitted`. No amount of re-reading
`close_muster_day` would have shown it. ⭐ **Generalises: when a function you are
widening calls another, the callee's gate is part of your change's surface — read the
call graph one level down, or drive it and read the SQLSTATE.**

**The resolution (operator-ruled 2026-08-06): least privilege, NOT the cheap fix.**
Adding `procurement` to `derive_muster_labor`'s list was rejected — it is directly
`authenticated`-executable, so that list is a real security boundary, and widening it
grants the labour engine's whole authority rather than "may re-close a day", and
persists after 368 U2 lights up the money. Instead the mechanism moved:

| function                       | gate                                   | reachable by                      |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `derive_muster_labor`          | **unchanged** role list                | `authenticated` (EXECUTE granted) |
| `close_muster_day`             | role list **+ `procurement`** + x-proj | `authenticated`                   |
| `derive_muster_labor_internal` | **none** — it is the mechanism         | **nobody** (EXECUTE revoked)      |

Every entry point authorizes before reaching the mechanism; the mechanism is
unreachable from `authenticated` and `anon`. Procurement gains exactly one power
(re-close, which derives as a consequence) and **no** ability to invoke a derive
directly — pinned in pgTAP, with the `super_admin` positive control that proves the
public gate was not narrowed either.

Two further bounds, both from the build's own self-review:

- **REGULAR sessions only.** `muster_scan_in`'s signature carries
  `p_session default 'regular'`, so the widening also handed procurement the `ot`
  arm — ×1.5 money (spec 351), never part of the ruling. The correction arm now
  refuses a non-regular session; the SA arm keeps both, which is the positive
  control that makes the bound procurement-specific rather than global.
- **The subcon money wall moved with the mechanism**, so
  `tests/unit/contractor-money-wall.test.ts` — which pins the LAST definition of
  `derive_muster_labor` carrying `v_worker.contractor_id is null` — went red. The
  wall was never lost, but the guard's REACH no longer covered the writer. Re-pointed
  at `derive_muster_labor_internal`, plus a new assertion that the public wrapper
  **delegates and does not itself `insert into public.labor_logs`** — without that,
  re-inlining a wall-less body later would pass on a stale `_internal` pin.

⚑ **Left alone deliberately:** `close_muster_day` still does not take
`derive_muster_labor`'s advisory key, so `reopen_muster_day`'s lock is one-sided and
cannot serialise against a concurrent close. **Pre-existing, not introduced here**,
and out of U3a's scope — but it is a real gap and belongs in its own unit. The new
correction arm in `muster_scan_in` DOES take that key, because its write is the one
that can invalidate derive's precondition.

### Why the window is open NOW

`labor_logs` is **0 rows all-time** — no worker has `cost_confirmed_at`, so
`derive_muster_labor` books nothing when a day closes. Attendance corrections
therefore have **zero wage consequence today**. That stops being true the moment
spec 368 U2 confirms the first rate, after which every correction on a closed day
moves money. Build the audited path while it is cheap, or build it later under a
money constraint.

Whichever option is chosen, the write must write `audit_log` — `reopen_muster_day`
already does (action `crew_change`, `payload->>'kind' = 'muster_day_reopen'`), and
that convention (existing action + a `kind`, never a new enum value) is the one to
follow.

---

## 4. Units

Order is load-bearing. U1 and U2 are code-only and additive; nothing they ship
removes an affordance, so they may land before the §3 ruling.

**U1 — the grid (code-only, no schema).**
Matrix over the range's attendance rows: worker rows, day columns, merged
regular+OT cells, per-cell marks for `บันทึกมือ` / `ยังไม่เช็คออก` / `ออกอัตโนมัติ`,
shaded non-working columns (D5), column headers carrying headcount + closure (D6),
the `?view=` toggle (D7), the horizontal scroll container (D8), the role-conditional
drill link (D9). Population = exactly today's (workers with attendance), so U1
changes the SHAPE only and can be judged on that alone.

**U2 — roster rows (code-only, no schema).**
Adds the workers with **no** attendance in the range, for the roles that can read
`workers` on the session client (D4). This is finding ① and it is purely additive:
the same grid gains rows. Ships the "11 of 41" fact.

**U3 — the correction path (schema, danger path). §3 is RULED; blocked only on the
schema lane.**
Widen `close_muster_day` and `muster_scan_in` to `procurement` with the
cross-project arm and an open-day guard, per §3's gate-check list; add the pgTAP
role-set pin U2 owes; then the affordances on the grid, gated on a TS set that
mirrors the RPC allowlists verbatim (the `MUSTER_REOPEN_ROLES` precedent).
Splittable as **U3a** (schema + pgTAP) → **U3b** (the affordances), the order spec
397 U1/U2 used.

**U4 — the check-out gap (schema, and it is older than this spec).**
There is no way to record a check-out at a PAST time, **for any role**. Verified
live: `muster_scan_out` sets `out_at = now()` and refuses a session that already has
one, and `close_muster_day` auto-outs `session = 'regular'` only — its own comment
says an open OT session "is left for the SA", and the SA has no control for it. So
an evening OT session left open prices garbage the next day and nothing can repair
it.

This is a pre-existing gap, carried until now only in the session lane notes rather
than in a spec — it belongs here because the grid is the surface that will make
those cells visible at scale: **23 of 67 August sessions (34%) have no check-out.**
Sequence after U3; same danger path.

---

## 5. Acceptance

Each is one query, and each answers "is it actually used", not "did it render".

1. **The audience arrives:** `select actor_role, count(*) from interaction_events
where route like '/team/attendance%' and created_at > now() - interval '14 days'
group by 1` — a `procurement` row must exist. It is **0 all-time** today.
2. **The grid is the view they keep:** the same query split by
   `context->>'view'` (or the route's query string) — `list` should not dominate.
3. **The finding is acted on:** `select count(*) from audit_log where action =
'crew_change' and payload->>'kind' = 'muster_day_reopen'` — **0 today**. A
   non-zero count is the first evidence the double-check loop closed end to end.
4. **U2's finding is real:** re-run the roster gap
   (`41 active / 30 appeared` in July) at the end of the next full month; if the gap
   is still ~11 the rows are earning their place, and if it collapses to 0 the
   feature has done its job.

---

## 6. Open / owed, deliberately not built

- **Which range does a checker actually want?** The report defaults to
  month-to-date. A grid may want "this week" as its default. Not decided; U1 keeps
  the existing default so the change is one variable at a time.
- **Sorting the rows.** Alphabetical is the current implicit order. Sorting by
  "most anomalies" is tempting and is the spec-375 trap in miniature — check the
  distribution before ranking on any column.
- **`project_coordinator` and `hr` have no `/team` door** (spec 358's owed note) and
  `procurement_manager` has no `/team` door at all (spec 397 §9 Q15). The grid does
  not fix nav; it inherits those gaps.
- **Cross-project cells.** A worker-day is provably single-project, so a cell can
  name an off-home project — 374's calendar already does. Not in U1's scope.
- The `/team/attendance` CSV export writes **no** `audit_log` row (spec 397's
  recorded item). Unchanged here, still owed a decision.
- ⚠️ **The `WORKER_ROSTER_ROLES` pin is ONE-DIRECTIONAL, and closing it is owed to U3.** U2's
  roster is a SESSION read, so it depends on the live `workers` "readable by staff" policy —
  but the test asserts the TypeScript array. It therefore catches someone WIDENING the role set
  and is blind to the POLICY being narrowed underneath it, which would produce a silent empty
  roster rather than a refusal. The pin belongs in pgTAP over the exhaustive role domain (the
  `358-attendance-audit.test.sql` precedent). It is deferred to U3 rather than built here only
  because U3 touches `supabase/` anyway, while U2 is otherwise code-only.
- **The grid path now costs four reads** — `audit_attendance_summary`, the
  full-range `audit_attendance_detail`, and the holidays select — and the summary's
  only remaining jobs on that path are the header totals, `unclosedDaySignal` and
  the empty-range gate, all of which the detail rows already carry. Collapsing it
  to one read is a real simplification and it changes what the header renders, so
  it is its own unit, not a U1 side effect. Found in review; trivial at today's
  volumes (261 detail rows for a month) and worth doing before the roster grows.
- **`บันทึกมือ` / `ออกอัตโนมัติ` are free string literals in several components**
  (6 and 3 copies in `src/`). The UI-term SSOT rule says a term used in 2+ places
  belongs in `labels.ts`; that file is one of the repo's two constant colliders, so
  hoisting them is a sweep of its own rather than a rider on this unit. `(+1 วัน)`
  was aligned here because it was a THIRD name for a fact two neighbouring surfaces
  already agreed on.
